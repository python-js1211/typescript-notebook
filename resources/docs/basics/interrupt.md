# Interrupting and clearing the state

If you have a long running piece of code you'd like to stop, then you can click on the stop icon next to the cell. You can optionally click on the `restart` icon on the top right of the editor toolbar.

Note:
* Restarting and interrupting is the same. All state information is lost.
* Closing a notebook, automatically kills the associated process.
